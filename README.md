Qt5 API for Google Maps using CMake

This repo was forked from [https://github.com/YuTinCH/qt-google-map](https://github.com/YuTinCH/qt-google-map).  The first major change was the addition of a CMakeLists.txt file to make this work with CMake in my other projects, but then I decided it could be improved significantly to be much more flexible, so I have rather extensively modified and added to the code.

NOTE: this project will currently not compile on its own.  This may change in the future, but for now, I only need it in an already-established cmake project.
