==============
Qt5 API for Google Maps using CMake

This repo was forked from [https://github.com/YuTinCH/qt-google-map](https://github.com/YuTinCH/qt-google-map), and the only change is the addition of a CMakeLists.txt file to make this work with CMake in my other projects.

NOTE: this project will currently not compile on its own.  This may change in the future, but for now, I only need it in an already-established cmake project.
